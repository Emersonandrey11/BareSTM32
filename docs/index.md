# Bare Metal programming on STM32 Microcontrollers

This tutorial is for those whom wants to learn how microcontrollers work and how to actually programming it.

## Motivation

There is a lot of tutorials in the internet about programming microcontrollers, but it seems to me that only by doing it yourself ones can actually learn. So, this tutorial is for myself...

## Goal

The goal of this tutorial is to understand how GPIOs in microcontrollers works and how to programming it wihtout and IDE. This will force me to fully understand the process.
