# Bare Metal programming on STM32 Microcontrollers


## Motivation

There are a lot of tutorials on the internet about programming microcontrollers, but it's rare to see a local where all the information you need is at one place. So this page intends to organize and teach you everything you need to know about bare metal programming on a STM32 microcontroller board.

## Hardware

For information about our microcontroller board, please checkout the [hardware](hardware.md) page. In this page you will find schematics and PCB designs made with KiCAD. 

## GNU ARM Toolchain

For information about compiling, debuggind and flashing code into the microcontroller, please checkout the [Toolchain](program.md) page. 

## STM32F030 Architecture 

For information and a tutorial about the STM32F030K6 microcontroller, please checkout the [STM32F030 architecture](micro.md) page.

## Coding

For information about the code, please checkout the [code](code.md) page.
