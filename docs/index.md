# Bare Metal programming on STM32 Microcontrollers

This tutorial is for those who want to learn how microcontrollers work and how to actually program them.

## Motivation

There are a lot of tutorials on the internet about programming microcontrollers, but it seems to me that one can only truly learn by doing it yourself. So, this tutorial is for myself...

- [Flash and program](program.md)
