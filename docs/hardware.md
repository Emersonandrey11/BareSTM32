# Hardware

The hardware is a basic microcontroller board which has only the necessary componentes to run it like:

- An LQFP32 STM32F030K6 microcontroller
- Header pins to access the microcontroller pins
- Reset button (connected directly to pin 4 - NRST)
- Pull-up/down switch connected on BOOT0 (Pin 31)
- User LED connected to PB1 (Pin 15)
- SWD header pin
